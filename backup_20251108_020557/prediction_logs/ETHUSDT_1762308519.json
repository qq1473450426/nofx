    "reasoning": "Despite short-term bullish momentum and high RSI indicating overbought conditions, price remains below all major EMAs in a strong downtrend. The bearish market structure, combined with negative social sentiment and extremely low market confidence, suggests that the rally is likely a corrective move within a broader distribution phase. Downward pressure is expected to resume as momentum fades.",
